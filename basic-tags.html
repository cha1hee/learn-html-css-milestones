      <h2>Block-Level containers</h2>
      <p>This text is contained inside a paragraph element. As you can see the
      paragraph element spans the entire column it is in. In this case, this
    page is a single column website thus the paragraph spans the entire width of
    the page and wraps itself around to the next row as you change the size of
    the page.</p>
      <blockquote cite="http://">
        This text is in a blockquote element tag. It is used to show clearly
        when the writer is quoting something by indenting the lines. There is
        also a cite attribute you can use to specify where the quote is from.
      </blockquote>
      <pre>This text
                    is in a
              pre element.
                              This means that the text is
        preformatted.
      So, it is text that will be written exactly as it is in the HTML file.
    You can check out the code for this page using inspect to see what I mean.</pre>

      <h2>Inline Text</h2>
      <em>This text is in the em elements of html. This means that the
      text is italicized, as you can see.</em>
      <i>This is text in the i element of html. This has the same effects as
        the em where it italices the letters but instead this element is used
        when writing in different languages or using special terms.</i>
      <strong>This text is obviously bolded. You can get bolded text by using
      the strong element in html. The strong element is used to highlight that
      the text is important.</strong>
      <b>Similarly this text is bolded as well. However, this text is written
      in a b element which is used to change the appearance but does not signify
      an type of importance in relation to the words around it.</b>
